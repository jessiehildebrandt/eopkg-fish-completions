= eopkg Fish Completions =
==== ( Version 1.0.0 ) ===
======= Installing =======

To install/use, either:

* Run "source eopkg.fish" from your fish shell (note that this method will
only provide the completions for the remainder of the active fish session).

- OR -

* Place "eopkg.fish" in the ~/.config/fish/completions/ folder. If this folder
does not exist, you will have to create it. Then, any fish session started by
the active user will now have working completions for eopkg. You will have to
restart any active fish sessions for the changes to take place.


= Known Issues =

* Tab completion of package names for "install", "remove" or related commands
will lock up the shell for several seconds when generating the cache file. This
is because eopkg is extremely slow in listing package names. Once the cache file
is generated, it will be valid for the next six hours and package name completions
will take place very quickly.
