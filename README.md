# eopkg Fish Completions
### Version 1.1.0

## Installing

There are two ways to use the completion definitions:

* Run "source eopkg.fish" from your fish shell (note that this method will
only provide the completions for the remainder of the active fish session).

* Place "eopkg.fish" in the ~/.config/fish/completions/ folder. If this folder
does not exist, you will have to create it. Then, any fish session started by
the active user will now have working completions for eopkg. You will have to
restart any active fish sessions in order for the changes to take place.

## Known Issues

* No known issues.
